# SECTION ONE

In this module i learned about the Unix OS and how to use the terminal to move between directories and files;

I also learned about Git, a version control system and how it makes updating code easy;

Finally, i learned about github and how to integrate it with git, so that a team can develop a project in a remotely and organized way.

Using this operating system, the terminal, git and github is becoming more natural to me every day, making me feel agile towards my goal of being a dev.

This directory contains class summaries and some exercises.
