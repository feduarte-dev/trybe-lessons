### Exercises 

1- Access the main branch and create a new branch called update-readme.

2- Access the update-readme branch and create a file called infos.txt.

3- Add staging changes and commit.

4- Add your first and last name to the infos.txt file.

5- Re-add staging changes and commit.

6- Create a new branch from the update-readme branch. The new branch should be called add-infos.

For example: “The first step is to have a versioned folder and create an initial structure, and we do this using the git init command. The second step is to create a new branch with the command git branch branch-name or git checkout -b branch-name…” that still has about versioning.

8- Add staging changes and commit.

9- Go back to the update-readme branch and merge the changes made in the add-infos branch.
