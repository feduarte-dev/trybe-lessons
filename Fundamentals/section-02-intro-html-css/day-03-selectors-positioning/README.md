### Exercise 1

/* insert in the .padding class a padding of 20px to apply it to items B, C and D */

/* insert in the .margin class a margin of 30px to apply it to items C and D */

/* insert in the .border class a border with value '5px solid black' to apply it to item D */

### Exercise 2

Set Mario above the Goomba.

Set Bowser to the right of the Goomba.

Set the balloon so that it becomes Bowser's speech.

Set the p-tag text so that it is inside the speech bubble.

### Exercise 3

Add a ranked list of the top 3 sites you know.

Create a file in the same directory and name it 'style.css'.

In that .css file, add the styles so that:

The text of the 'h1' and 'p' tags are centered.
The background color of your list changes when the cursor is over the item.
The item's font changes when it is clicked.
Add an unordered list of at least 3 features you like.

In the 'style.css', add the property 'list-style: none' for both lists.

### Exercise 4

Style the divs so that when hovering over them, they gain a border.

Make each div have its own background color.

Style each of the h3 tags however you see fit (color, size, style, and family).

Make the third div bigger than the others.

Leave the odd h3 tags with the text in italics.

### Exercise 5 

Create the style.css file and complete the following exercises:

Make all Ordered List items have a yellow background color. If item numbering is EVEN, make the font color green. If the number is considered ODD, use the text-transform property to make the text uppercase. (Hint: combining classes can be useful here).

Make all Header tags (h1, h2…) have red font color, if any of them are italicized, increase their size to 40px and add a solid black 1px border.

Make all li's 20px font size, and for all italicized text within any li, use the font-weight property to make it bold.

In the list of programming languages, make the first 3 of the list have a blue font color and, if any have “java*” in the text, use a pink background color.

(Bonus) For each link in the developer person's allies list, make hovering over each link make the text bold and take on the “site-themed” font color.
