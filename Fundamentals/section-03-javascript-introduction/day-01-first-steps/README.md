### Exercise 1
Create a variable called myName and give it your name (Example: Carolina).
Create a variable called birthCity and assign it to your hometown.
Create a variable called birthYear and assign the year you were born to it.
Use console.log() to print the variables you created.

### Exercise 2
Create a variable called base and assign it the value 5.
Create a variable called height and assign it the value 8.
Create a variable called area and assign to it the result of multiplying the base by the height. Tip: remember to always use console.log() to print the variables and check the results of the operations!
Create a variable called perimeter and assign it the sum of all sides of the rectangle.

# Exercise 3
Create a variable that takes a candidate's grade in a technical challenge and assigns it a value between 1 and 100.
Implement a logic that checks whether the candidate has been approved, rejected or is on the waiting list. To do this, consider the following information:
  -If the grade is greater than or equal to 80, print “Congratulations, you are part of the group of approved people!”.
  -If the score is less than 80 and greater than or equal to 60, print “You are on our waiting list.”.
  -If the grade is less than 60, print "Unfortunately, you failed.".
Create a conditional structure using if, else if and else to create your algorithm and the logical operators that apply to each situation.
Change the note value to verify that the conditions you implemented work.

# Exercise 4
Create a variable called “currentHour” that receives a number between 4 and 24, according to your choice, to represent the hours of the day.
Create a variable called “message” that initially is an empty string.
Implement the following conditionals:
  -If the time is greater than or equal to 22, enter “We shouldn't eat anything, it's bedtime” in the “message” variable.
  -If the time is greater than or equal to 18 and less than 22, insert “Evening food, let's have dinner :D” in the “message” variable.
  -If the time is greater than or equal to 14 and less than 18, enter “Shall we bake a cake for breakfast?” in the “message” variable.
  -If time is greater than or equal to 11 and less than 14, enter “Lunch time!!!” in the “message” variable.
  -If the time is between 4 and 11, enter “Hmmm, smell of freshly brewed coffee” in the “message” variable.
  Now print the message variable outside your conditions.

# Exercise 5
Create a variable called “weekDay” that receives the string “Wednesday”.
Using if/else, implement the following conditionals:
If the variable “weekDay” is “Monday”, “Tuesday”, “Wednesday”, “Thursday” or “Friday”, print “Yay, another day of learning at Trybe >: D”.
If the variable is some weekend day, print “FINALLY, well deserved rest! UwU!”.

# Exercise 6
Create a variable to store the candidate's status in a selection process. The possibilities are: 'approved', 'listed' or 'disapproved'.
Create a conditional structure with switch/case to print the following messages:
If 'approved', print “Congratulations, you are in the group of approved people!”.
If 'list', print “You are on our waiting list.”.
If 'failed', print “Unfortunately, you failed.”.
If default, print the message “Incorrect information.”.
