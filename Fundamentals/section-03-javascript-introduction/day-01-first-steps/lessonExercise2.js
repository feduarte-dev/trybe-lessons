// Create a variable called base and assign it the value 5.
// Create a variable called height and assign it the value 8.
// Create a variable called area and assign to it the result of multiplying the base by the height. Tip: remember to always use console.log() to print the variables and check the results of the operations!
// Create a variable called perimeter and assign it the sum of all sides of the rectangle.
let base = 5;
let height = 8;
let area = base * height;
let perimeter = base * 2 + height * 2;

console.log(area);
console.log(perimeter);
